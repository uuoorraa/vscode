                <p>Breeze through the basics with this quick and handy guide.</p>
                <p class="para">Welcome to Trello!</p>
                <p>Whether you’re at work, at home, or anywhere in between, Trello’s simple and flexible design lets your team collaborate and organize everything (literally, everything—from the day-to-day operations of your business to your next family vacation).</p>
                <P class="para">Getting Started With Trello</P>
                <P>Getting set up and running with a new app is no small task, so we’ll guide you through Trello onboarding with speed and simplicity in mind. You’ll have your team collaborating in Trello in no time!</P>
                <P class="para">Board Basics</P>
                <P>A Trello board only has four key components, but comes with unlimited possibility:</P>
                    <img src="images/01.png" width="800">
                <P class="mark">Boards - A board represents a project or a place to keep track of information. Whether you are launching a new website, or planning a vacation, a Trello board is the place to organize your tasks and collaborate with your colleagues, family, or friends.</P>
                <p class="mark">Lists - Lists keep cards (C) organized in their various stages of progress. They can be used to create a workflow where cards are moved across lists from start to finish, or simply act as a place to keep track of ideas and information. There’s no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board, and they can be arranged however you like.</p>
                    <img src="images/List.png" width="800">
                <p>A basic (but effective) list setup for a board might be simply To Do, Doing, and Done, where cards start in the To Do list and make their way to the Done list. But don’t forget: Trello is truly customizable to your unique needs, so you can name your lists anything you like! Whether it’s basic Kanban, a sales pipeline, a marketing calendar, or project management, what matters most is establishing a workflow for the way your team works.</p>
                    <img src="images/List2.jpg" width="800">
                <p class="mark">Cards - The fundamental unit of a board is a card. Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done, like a blog post to be written, or something that needs to be remembered, like company vacation policies. Just click “Add a card…” at the bottom of any list to create a new card, and give it a name like “Pick up the dry cleaning” or “Write a blog post.”</p>
                <p>Cards can be customized to hold a wide variety of useful information by clicking on them. Drag and drop cards across lists to show progress. There’s no limit to the number of cards you can add to a board.</p>
                    <img src="images/cards.png" width="400">
                <p class="mark">Menu - On the right side of your Trello board is the menu—the mission control center for your board. The menu is where you manage members, control settings, filter cards, and enable Power-Ups. You can also see all of the activity that has taken place on a board in the menu’s activity feed. Take some time to check out everything the menu has to offer.</p>
                <p>Sounds pretty simple, right? Let’s get started by creating your first board, but first, think of a project or goal to work on. You can start from logging in your <a href="./登录页面.html">Board!</a></p>
